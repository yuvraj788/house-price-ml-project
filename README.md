House Price Prediction & Classification
This project focuses on predicting and classifying house prices using machine learning models. The dataset used is a CSV file containing housing price data, and the project includes the following key steps:

Key Steps:
Data Loading and Cleaning:
The raw housing price data is preprocessed by handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Data Visualization:
Various visualizations are generated to understand the distribution and relationships between features, including:
Heatmap: To visualize the correlation between different features.
Scatter Plots: To show the relationships between numerical features and the target variable (price).
Count Plot: To analyze the distribution of categorical features.
Feature Engineering:
New features are created, such as categorizing the house prices into two groups (above or below the median), which is useful for classification tasks.

Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

Machine Learning Models Applied: Several classification models are implemented to predict whether a house's price is above or below the median:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Model Evaluation:
Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to determine their effectiveness in classifying house prices.
than we find the final result
